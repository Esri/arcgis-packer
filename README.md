# arcgis-packer

This repository contains a Packer template and helper scripts that let you create customized Microsoft Azure images. You might need to create a custom image to meet governance, security, and patch requirements at your organization. Use these custom images with ArcGIS Enterprise Cloud Builder for Microsoft Azure to build virtual machines on the Azure cloud.   

## Instructions and Requirements
